This project is inspired by https://codecanyon.net/item/resumen-multistep-resume-builder/28990151

I just used their css and html, So i can focus in react more. Here i used Konva Library, JsPDF.

Resume builder is dynamic and once you start writing, content won't overlap and position of below content will be changed. 

You get download pdf option and it can be multy page too. 

Main package used are : Redux ToolKit, Konva( for canvas), JsPDF ( Download PDF)
